There are several scenarios in this code where a rollback might occur:

    If the user is not found in the database: If the query to retrieve the user data from the database (SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?) does not return any rows, it means that the user was not found. In this case, the code executes await pool.query("ROLLBACK") to rollback the transaction, and then returns a response with a status of 401 and an error message "User not found".

    If an error occurs during the execution of the code: If an error occurs during the execution of any of the database queries or transactions, such as a syntax error, a connection error, or a constraint violation, the catch block will be triggered. The code then executes await pool.query("ROLLBACK") to rollback the transaction, logs the error to the console with console.error(err), and returns a response with a status of 500 and an error message "Internal Server Error".

In both of these scenarios, the transaction will be rolled back to its initial state, undoing any changes made within the transaction, and an appropriate error response will be sent to the client.
